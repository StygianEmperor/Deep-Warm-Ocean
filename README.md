# Deep Warm Ocean - a 1.16.4 mod for Minecraft Forge
Did you know that Deep Warm Ocean biomes don't generate naturally in Minecraft? This finally implements them so they can.

I wanted to build an undersea base with a big glass dome amidst a coral reef. Then I found out that while all four of the other-temperature oceans (lukewarm, ocean, cold, and frozen) had a "deep" variant, warm oceans - *the only oceans with coral reefs* - were unfairly left out; *deep* warm oceans do not generate. An unfinished version of them exists already in Minecraft's files, but it can only be seen in buffet-type worlds and it's missing the crucial coral reef part.

**To find and visit a deep warm ocean quickly in your world, use the command** `/locatebiome deepwarmocean:deep_warm_ocean` **followed by** `/tp 0000 ~ 0000`**, replacing the 0000's with the coordinates displayed in the chat by the previous command.**

Admittedly I have no idea what I'm doing; I just used MCreator to make a super-simple mod that injects a sparse "dummy" biome into Minecraft's Overworld and then snuck a single-file datapack into the .jar that changes that dummy biome into a deeper version of the naturally-spawning warm ocean biome, complete with coral reefs.
